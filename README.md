# bash_scripts
A random collection of bash scripts that I use now and again. Nothing special, just practical for me to put it somewhere

## LLDP
A simple script to enable LLDP on a Linux host, and one to get the LLDP info of the ports on the host

## libvirt
Simple bash scripts to do libvirt stuff, like creating a VM
